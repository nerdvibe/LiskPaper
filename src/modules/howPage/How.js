              <p>
                One of the most exciting things you can do with your Lisk is to
                send them to a piece of paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                First of all, the first rule of crypto-club is: Your keys — Your
                Lisk, Not your keys — Not your Lisk.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the most specific sense, a Lisk paper wallet is a document
                containing all of the data necessary to access a the wallet from
                Lisk Nano.

                What are the benifits of having a paper wallet?
              </h2>
              <p>
                A paper wallet can be generated offline and allows you to have a
                copy of your copy literally on a piece of paper

                What can I do with a paper wallet?
              </h2>
              <p>
                With a Lisk paper wallet you can store you Lisk passphrase away
                of a computer. If the paper wallet is stored properly then this
                might be considered an extra layer of security in storing your
                passphrase
              </p>
              <p>
                Another use case of a paper wallet is to gift it to friends for
                example for Christmas. Let&apos;s say you want to give 10 Lisk to
                John, but John doesn&apos;t know how to create a Lisk wallet. You
                could create a Lisk Paper Wallet for John, send some Lisk to the
                generated address and then gift the paper wallet to him.

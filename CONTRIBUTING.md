# How to contribute to Liskhunt

If you are interested in contributing to LiskPaper, well you are a wonderful person.

We are always looking for people to help to bring LiskPaper to the next level.


## The flow

You should start by checking the issues page, if you find an issue suitable to you, ask to be assigned to you.
In case you didn't find any issue suitable to you, but instead you want to propose a new feature/report new bug, open a new issue. It will be discussed and brainstormed together :)

- Fork this repository
- Make your changes
- Create a pull request to this repository
- Run prettier on the code. You should install prettier and then before making the PR execute the command `prettier --write src/**/*.js`
- Somebody then will review it, give a feedback and merge it.

If you want to get in touch with the main contributors of the repo you can get in touch with @xunga on github or contact carbonara on the lisk.chat.


## What is not so nice to do :(

Open a new PR for something that has not been discussed.
